<h2 id="coding">Coding</h2>
	<p>I got interested in coding during my sophmore year. During my Computer class.</p>
	<p>When I was younger, I thought coding was really cool. But I honestly totally forgot coding existed once I started getting involved with sports, but when I saw a review on it, I really wanted to learn it.</p>

<h2 id="sports">Sports</h2>
	<p>I was always involved in sports.</p>
	<p>First I was a soccer and karate person, but then I got really involved with basketball, and some point I did track but I didn't really enjoy track that much</p>

<h2 id="movies">Movies</h2>
	<p>I am a BIG movie person. I watch at least one movie everyday, and whenever a new movie comes out I always find a way to watch it as soon as possible.</p>

<h2 id="skateboarding">Skateboarding</h2>
	<p>I started skateboarding in 5th grade. I would just skate around the trail by my house. At first I wasn't good at it, but with more practice I improved.</p>
	<p>I currently own a regular skateboard and a crusor.</p>
	<p>A little "goal" I have for when I'm older is I want to own at least one type of every board.</p>
	<p>Which means a skateboard, a crusor, a penny board, a longboard, and a nickel board. </p>
